# Netflix Clone UI

## Description 

This project was to create a clone of the Netflix home page using primarily HTML and CSS.  Almost no Javascript was used.

I wanted to work on my CSS skills to get better at creating something based on a wireframe or in this case to copy a pre-existing website.

In order to create this I followed a Youtube tutorial by DanaScript.
